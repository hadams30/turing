Repo for @MX_TURING twitter disruption tool

@MX_TURING is an evolving twitter bot performance and open source project created to dissolve cyber-sexism from the inside out. By occupying the presumably human space of an online profile and developing an opinionated identity, this bot acts as a tool to enable the viewer to look inside the twittersphere and utilize the power of code to disrupt online harassment.

Systematically displaced minorities should own the digital sphere where social restrictions can be dissolved! Let @MX_TURING teach you how to reach into the internet and customize it through code. 

This work is hyper-open-source and completely customizable for individual use! The demo video online ensures that @MX_TURING can be utilized with no coding experience. Crack open the internet for your own needs! 

TOOLS:
	rt.js is a search and retweet function where the user inputs random keywords to get biased and harassment based results, showing the depth of twitter hate and cyber-sexism.
	archive.js digs through a bank of related information and theory to compose tweets using direct quotes and new evolved statements developed through a markov chain twitter bot library. These new statements push @MX_TURINGâ€™s own cyber-reality and further displaces human bias from the online realm. 

Both of these tools are completely customizable; the archive array in archive.js can be replaced with sentences that strike your fancy and promote the visibility of the systematic displacement of your own personal identity. The search functions in rt.js filter the general twitter search results with custom filters to bring up tweets relating to sexist harassment, but these keywords can be altered to pinpoint microaggressions against your community in particular. This work is meant to enable any systematically displaced group to access the twittersphere and displace harassment through code, and I encourage you to share with me any changes you make to my code.

If you know javascript or node and have improvements to the code or additions to improve pc accessibility, send me a github pull request.
